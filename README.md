# NXTheme tutorials

If you want to learn more about Nintendo Switch themeing, this repository might be for you. I still recommend to read through [LayoutDocs](layoutdocs.themezer.net/) where basics you will be needing are covered.

## Available tutorials

- [Creating custom animations for your NX themes](https://github.com/Kalyvara/NXTheme-tutorials/blob/main/anims/tuto_anims.md) (also available on [LayoutDocs](https://layoutdocs.themezer.net/guide/animations/))
- [Add or edit a custom background image to any theme](https://github.com/Kalyvara/NXTheme-tutorials/blob/main/layouts/custom-bg.md)

## Planned (maybe)

- Layout editing for unsupported applets
